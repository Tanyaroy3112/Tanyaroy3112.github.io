<p><strong><u>Trip Guidelines</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Fellow Travelers,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Eco-Traveler, at the offset we are extremely excited and totally looking forward to host a memorable trip for you. We love living in outdoors and the adrenaline, we also believe that it is truly the greatest gift of God, the beauty and magic outdoors, hence the need to respect it. We are laying very basic and easy to do guidelines for the same with the motive of leaving minimum footprint, preserving the flora, fauna, biodiversity and ecology of the region along with coming close to local communities and culture of the region. We truly believe that you will help us in initiating this and become an Eco-Traveler, if not already one.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>A little on what Ecotourism exactly is</strong></p>
<p>A dictionary defines it as "tourism directed towards unspoilt natural environments and intended to support conservation efforts". In addition, Eco-Traveler believes in supporting, protection and at the same time experiencing local culture and heritage. Tourism results in social, as well as environmental impacts, and a responsible tourist needs to be aware of this.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here is how you can help</strong></p>
<p>Carrying <strong>your own</strong> water bottle, cups, plates and filling water from natural resource, <strong>drinking locally brewed products</strong> served in glass or recyclable materials.</p>
<p>Using litter bins to trash items that do not decompose, <strong>minimum use of purchases packed in plastic</strong>, carry a <strong>waste bag</strong> for your personal non-biodegradable waste.</p>
<p>Enjoying watching the <strong>biodiversity</strong> of the geography<strong>, not playing loud music or being loud</strong>, when we go outdoors, we are borrowing home of animals and birds, it&rsquo;s our responsibility to ensure they are not disturbed.</p>
<p>Purchasing locally produced items- from handicrafts to breweries to savories</p>
<p>Keeping minimum carbon footprint and <strong>nil plastic footprints</strong> on the trail through not burning plastic or wood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Things an Eco-Traveler carries</strong></p>
<p>Apart from personal clothing and toiletries following items need to be carried in order to make this do it yourself and minimum footprint trek and also for your personal convenience-</p>
<p>Carry your own water bottle, tea up and a tiffin box for packing lunch, instead of using disposable packing material. Water bottle with filters are available, however the natural resources are clean and pristine. It&rsquo;s good to carry dry fruits and nuts for personal use.</p>
<p>Carry a day bag pack, we will provide potters for those need it, however only essentials can be carried for an overnight trek in a day pack.</p>
<p>A waste bag to collect waste on the way in your day pack.</p>
